# Energy_Effecient-_Comm_In_WSM
This is a Java based project. In this project I designed and implemented an energy efficient communication application for wireless sensor networks.

A wireless sensor network consists of a set of sensor devices that communicate with each other via wireless links. Building an infrastructure for wireless sensor network that guarantees energy efficient communication is an important problem. Assume that we want to deploy a sensor network in an area to take temperature measurements and collect some statistics such as minimum, average, or maximum temperature in the area. We know about the topology information for a sensor network deployment.

One of the sensor nodes in the network is marked as a sink node. The sink node will issue queries into the network to collect a desired temperature statistic (min/average/max) from the network. One critical requirement in collecting this statistic is to ensure an energy efficient approach to disseminate the query to other sensor nodes and to ensure an energy efficient approach to collect the desired statistic from the nodes in the network.

My main job in this project was to come up with a design for a spanning tree construction algorithm for efficient dissemination of query messages and to come up with a design for a protocol for energy efficient collection of the requested statistics in the network.
